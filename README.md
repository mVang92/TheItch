I have to test, all the time!

Selinium and Chrome web driver are included.
The chromedriver folder (includes the chromedriver.exe file) is inside the selinium folder. The chromedriver folder must be moved to "C:".
Install TestNG in Eclipse by navigating to Help -> Install New Software.
In the Work With input box, add this link: http://dl.bintray.com/testng-team/testng-eclipse-release/
Click the Add button.
After about a minute, TestNG will appear in the search box.
Click Next, agree to any terms, and finish.
Restart Eclipse, and verify the TestNG library has been installed to your project.
